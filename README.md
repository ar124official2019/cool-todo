A very simple and cool todo app for demonstration of MERN Stack

**App is still under development!**

## Development
To run the project in development mode, here is a quick recipe.

git clone https://github.com/ar124official2019/cool-todo
cd cool-todo
git checkout dev # Make sure you are in `dev`elopment branch

# Install Node Modules
